/// edge, which is right for the polygons of a single shape, but not for
/// polygons that overlap or lie inside of each other, as the paths of an SVG
/// file often do: the closest edge may belong to a polygon that does not
/// contain the origin of the ray, even though another one does.
///
/// This hitbox instead considers a ray inside of the hitbox when it starts
/// inside of any of its polygons, and reports the first point where the ray
/// enters the union of the polygons, or leaves it when it starts inside. The
/// edges between polygons that are inside of the union are ignored. Like in
/// [PathHitbox], polygons are solid, so the holes in them count as inside.
